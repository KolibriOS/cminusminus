The conditional instructions.
-------------------------------

    The conditional instructions, through which the branching, such is
carried out as in C.

    C-- has two instructions of branching - if and IF.

    If makes close branch on condition, and IF makes short (8-digit) branch
on condition. IF is executed faster and can save up to 3 bytes in the size of
the code, but can carry out transitions only within the limits of 127 bytes
code.

    The conditional instructions, as well as in C, can be accompanied as
single by the command, and block from several commands, made in curly
brackets { }. The conditional instructions have the same limitations, as
conditional Expressions.

    If the instruction IF is followed more than 127 bytes of the code, by the
compiler will produce the following message on an error:

        IF jump distance too far, use if.

    It can simple be corrected, by replacing in this place the instruction
IF on if.

    The else and ELSE commands are used precisely the same as in the C
language. Difference them in that ELSE has limitation of the jump address of
127 bytes, same both IF. Esle generates the code on 1 byte longer, than ESLE.

    The IF and else commands, and also if and ELSE can freely mix up as in
the following example:

        if (x == 2)
            WRITESTR ("Two");
        ELSE {WRITESTR (" not two. ");
              Printmorestuff ();
           }

    If the instruction ELSE is followed more than 127 bytes of the code,
by the compiler will produce the following message on an error:

        ELSE jump distance too far, use else.

    It can simple be corrected, by replacing in this place the instruction
ELSE on esle.

Cycles do {} while.
--------------------

    In such cycle the block of the code making an iteration body, will
repeat, while the conditional has value "true".

    The truth of the conditional is checked after execution of an iteration
body, Therefore block of the code will be executed at least once.

 The example do {}, while of a cycle, in which body will be executed five
times:

         count = 0;
         do {
            count ++;
            WRITEWORD (count);
            WRITELN ();
           } while (count < 5);

The conditional in do {} while of the instruction should correspond to those
to rules, as in the instructions IF and if.

Cycles loop, LOOPNZ, loopnz.
------------------------------

    The cycles loop repeat the block of the code, while defined variable or
the register executing a role of the counter of a cycle, contain value,
distinct from zero. At the end of execution of the block of the code making
an iteration body, indicated, the variable or register - decreases on 1, and
then is checked on equality to zero. If the variable (or register) is not
equal to zero, the iteration body will be is executed again, and the process
will be repeated.

    Example of use of a cycle loop in which as the counter of a cycle the
variable is used:

        Count = 5;
        Loop (count)
            {WRITEWORD (count);
            WRITELN ();
           }

    The greatest effect gives use of the register CX for cycles with small
the body, as in this case by compiler generates a cycle with application the
machine LOOP command.

    If before start the counter of cycles contains zero value, command the
iteration body will be executed a maximum number of times for a range of
variable (256 times for the 8-bit counter (variable of a type byte or char),
65536 for the 16-bit counter (variable of a type word or int), and 4294967296
for the 32-bit counter (variable of a type dword or long)).

 In the following example the cycle will be executed 256 times:

         BH = 0;
         Loop (BH)
            {
           }

    If in the command is not indicated of any counter of a cycle, the cycle
will be to proceed indefinitely.

    The following example continuously will output character of an asterisk
(*) on the screen:

        loop ()
            WRITE ('*');

    The programmer, if wants, can use or to change value by variable of the
counter of a cycle inside a cycle.

    For example, the following cycle will be executed only 3 times:

         CX = 1000;
         loop (CX)
            {
            IF (CX > 3)
                CX = 3;
           }
    The cycle can also be interrupted by an operator of break BREAK or break.
Here that an example with use BREAK:

         CX = 1000;
         loop (CX)
            {
            IF (CX > 3)
                BREAK;
           }

    The cycles LOOPNZ/loopnz differ from a cycle loop, that before an input
in the cycle is checked equality to zero of argument of a cycle. If the
argument is equal to zero, that iteration body will be never executed (in a
cycle loop in this case iteration body the maximum number of times) will be
executed.

! Short a Cycle ^ Bwhile of ^ B, ^ BWHILE ^ B.
				 Cycle while, WHILE.

     Syntax:
  While (<expression>)
       <Operator>

    The cycle is executed so long as the value of <expression> will not become
False. <Expression> in the beginning is calculated. If <expression> initially is false,
That body of an operator while is not executed at all and the handle at once is transferred
On following(тnext) an operator of the program.

    The cycle WHILE is similar to a cycle while, but thus the code on 3 is generated
Than byte is shorter. The size of the generated code in a cycle WHILE should be less
127 bytes.

  Examples:
	 While (i < 20) {
		 W(i))
		 I ++;
	}

	 WHILE (i < 20) W(i)) 	 // the cycle or will be infinite or not
                                        // Will be executed never

! Short a Cycle ^ Bfor of ^ B, ^ BFOR ^ B.
				 Cycle for, FOR.

     Syntax:
  For ([< initial expression >]; [<condition>]; [< increment >])
    <Operator>

    The cycle for is executed so long as the value of <condition> will not become
False. If <condition> initially is false, a body of an operator for at all
The handle at once is executed operator of the program also is transferred on following(тnext).
< Initial expression > and <increment> are usually used for initialization
And modification of parameters of a cycle.

    First step at execution for is the calculation < initial
Expressions >, if it is present. Then the condition > is calculated < and is made
It an estimation as follows:

    1) If <condition> is true, the body of an operator is executed. Then
<Increment> is calculated (if it is), and the process repeats.

    2) If <condition> is lowered(omitted), it the value is accepted for true. In
This case the cycle for represents an infinite cycle, which can
To be completed only at execution in it a body of operators break, goto,
Return.

    3) If <condition> is false, the looping for comes to an end and
The handle is transferred to the following operator.

    The cycle FOR is similar to a cycle for, but thus the code on 3 bytes is generated
Shorter. The size of the generated code in a cycle FOR should be less than 127
Byte.

  Examples:
	 For (i = 0; i < 5; i ++) {
		 WRITESTR ("STRING"("LINE"));
		 W(i))
		 WRITELN ();
	}
    The number < of initial expressions > and number of <increments> is not limited. Everyone
The operator in < initial expressions > and <increments> should be divided
By comma. An example:

      For (a = 1, b = 2; a < 5; a ++, b + = a) {...

    Also there is a possibility of logical association of <conditions>. To unite
It is possible up to 32 conditions. Each joined condition should be made in
Brackets. An example:

      For (a = 0; (a> = 0) . . (a < 10); a ++) {...

! Short an Operator the switch ^ Bswitch of ^ B.
			 Operator the switch switch.

    Syntax:
  Switch (<expression>) {
    Case <constant>:
      <Operator>
	...
    Case <constant>:
      <Operator>
	...
    ...
    Default:
      <Operator>
 }
    The operator the switch switch is intended for a choice of one of
Several alternate paths of execution of the program. The execution begins
From calculation of value of <expression>. After that the handle is transferred to one
From <operators> of a body of the switch. In a body of the switch contain
Constructions: case <constant>:, which syntactically represent
Labels of operators. The operator receiving handle, is that operator,
Value of which constant coincide with value of <expression>
The switch. The value of <constant> should be unique.

    The execution of a body of an operator - switch switch begins with, selected,
Thus of operator up to the end of a body or so long as also proceeds
Any operator will not transfer handle for bounds of a body.

  The operator the following behind the default key word, is executed, if any
From constants is not equal to value of <expression>. If default is lowered(omitted), any
The operator in a body of the switch is not executed, and the handle is transferred on
Operator the following for switch.

    For an output(exit) from a body of the switch the operator of break is usually used
Break (BREAK).

  Example:
  S(i))
    Case 'A':
      W(i))
      I ++;
      BREAK;
    Case 32:
      WRITE ('_');
      I ++;
      BREAK;
    Default:
      WRITE ('i');
 }

    The operator 'switch' now in the compiler can be realized two
By ways: tabulared and method of sequential checks.

    The tabulared method is fastest, and at the large number of operators
'Case' and at an insignificant difference between maximum and minimum
By values 'case' it(he) still can be and more compact. But at him(it) is and
Disadvantages: in a 16-bit mode the compiler always uses the register BX, and in
32-bit mode, if an operand 'switch' is the register, it value
Will be desroyed.

    The method of sequential checks was used by the compiler earlier, but in
This version it(he) has varied slightly: the block of matchings is transferred in a beginning of a body
Operator 'switch', it has allowed to be saved from 1-2 superfluous 'jmp'. But
Now compiler can not define(determine), what type of transition to use at
To check of values 'case'. Now it will be by your care. If the size
The code from a beginning of a body of an operator 'switch' up to the location of an operator
'Case' is less than 128 bytes, it is possible to use short transition. In it
Case you can specify an operator 'CASE', that will result in generation more
The compact code. The compiler in warnings will to you prompt about
Possibilities of use of operators 'CASE'. Use of an operator
'CASE' in cases, when the size of the block of the code more than 128 bytes will result in output
By the compiler of the message about an error.

    By optimization of the code on the size, the compiler previously calculates
The size of the code, which can be obtained by both methods and realizes
Compact. By optimization on speed the advantage is given back tabulared
To method, if the size of the table turns out not too large.

    For an operator 'switch' the form - 'SWITCH' is entered as well short it.
It can be applied in case the size of the block of the code between the beginning of a body
Operator and operator 'default' (if it(he) is absent, by the end of a body
Operator 'switch') there are less than 128 bytes. About possibility of use of short
The forms the compiler will communicate in warnings.

    For an operator case/CASE, which can be used only in a body
The block of an operator switch/SWITCH, it is possible to specify a range of values. At first
It is necessary to specify smaller value, then after dots greater. An example:

Switch (AX) {
  Case 1... 5:
    WRITESTR (" Range AX from 1 to 5 ");
    BREAK;
};

    Earlier you had to write a more bulky construction:

Switch (AX) {
  Case 1:
  Case 2:
  Case 3:
  Case 4:
  Case 5:
    WRITESTR (" Range AX from 1 to 5 ");
    BREAK;
};

    Besides that the new format of record is more compact and more читабелен,
But thus the compiler creates the more compact and fast code.


! Short an Operator of transition ^ Bgoto of ^ B, ^ BGOTO ^ B.
			 Operator of transition goto, GOTO.

     Syntax:
     Goto <label>;
	.
	.
	.
<Label>:

    The operator of transition goto transfers handle on <operator,> marked,
<Neat>. Analogue in the assembler to an operator goto is the jmp near command.
Analogue in the assembler to an operator GOTO is the jmp short command.

! Short an Operator of break ^ Bbreak of ^ B, ^ BBREAK ^ B.
			 Operator of break break, BREAK.

    The operator of break break interrupts execution of operators do-while, for,
Switch, while, loop, loopnz, LOOPNZ. It(he) can contain only in a body
These operators. The handle is transferred to the operator, following(тnext) interrupted,
By cycle.

  The operator BREAK is similar break, but thus the code on 1 byte is generated
Shorter. The size of the generated code from a place where is applied BREAK up to
The end of a cycle should be less than 127 bytes.

  Examples:
	 FOR (i = 0;; i ++) {
		 FOR (j = 0; j < WIDTH; j ++) {
			 IF (i == 5) BREAK;
		}
		 IF (i == 10) BREAK;
	}

! Short an Operator of continuation ^ Bcontinue of ^ B, ^ BCONTINUE ^ B.
		 Operator of continuation continue, CONTINUE.

  The operator of continuation continue transfers handle to the following iteration in
Cycles do-while, for, while, loop, loopnz. In cycles do-while, while, loop
The following iteration begins with calculation of the conditional. For a cycle
For the following iteration begins with calculation of expression of increment, and
Then there is a calculation of the conditional.

  The operator CONTINUE is similar continue, but thus the code on 1 is generated
Byte is shorter. The size of the generated code from a place where is applied CONTINUE
Prior to the beginning iteration should be less than 127 bytes.

! Short Logical association of conditions.
			 Logical association of conditions.

    Since the version of the compiler 0.209 the possibility of logical has appeared
Associations of matchings in conditions IF and if, cycles do {} while, while {},
WHILE {}, for {} and FOR {}. Each matching at their logical association
Should be made in brackets. It is possible to unite no more than 32 matchings.

    As against си in C - the analysis of logical associations occurs at the left
To the right and all superfluous brackets will be perceived(recognized) by the compiler as erroneous.
It reduces flexibility and a little possibility of application of these associations,
But the tradition and philosophy incorporated in C - is those.

    Example:

	 If ((a> 3) . . (b> 4) || (c < 8)) {

I.e. if произвисти decryption of this condition, the following will turn out:
The condition will be executed if a> 3 and b> 4 or a> 3 and c < 8.

! Short Transition through cycles.

   For operators BREAK, break, CONTINUE, continue the support is entered
The numerical parameter defining how many of cycles is necessary to skip, before
Than this operator will be executed. For example we have three nested cycles:

Do {
   Loop (CX) {
      For (BX = 0; BX < 10; BX ++) {
	 Break; 	 // a standard operator
	 Break 0; // break with the parameter - to skip 0 cycles
	 Break 1; // break with the parameter - to skip 1 cycle
	 Break 2; // break with the parameter - to skip 2 cycles
     }
LABL0:
  }
LABL1:
} While (DX! = 0);
LABL2:

    In the third cycle there is a group of various variants of an operator 'break'.
To first cost(stands) a standard operator 'break' at which execution
The handle will be transferred for bounds of the third cycle - to a label 'LABL0'.
Second goes an operator ' break 0 ' at which execution will be missed 0
Cycles and the handle will be transferred(handed) again on a label 'LABL0'. Thus
Record 'break' and ' break 0 ' are synonyms. Third goes an operator
 ' Break 1 ' at which execution one cycle and handle will be missed
Will be transferred(handed) for bounds of the second cycle on a label 'LABL1'. Well and at last
The latter goes an operator ' break 2 ' at which execution the compiler
Will skip two cycles and will transfer handle for bounds third to a label
 'LABL2'. Labels in this example проставлены for convenience of an explanation. Well and I
I hope to you clearly, that the value of the parameter can not exceed numbers of cycles
Taking place before current. So for a single cycle this parameter can
To accept maximum and unique(sole) value - 0.

For example:

  IF (i = a + 2! = 0)...
  IF (i ++)...
